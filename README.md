# Initial page

## The Setting

Huge mountains, dense forests and deep lakes. The idea is that /magic mother nature/ is a force to be feared and revered by even the mightiest kingdoms. Magic remains a mystery, don't get lost in the woods.

## The Rules

The rules should favor realism over playability. The rules should be light. The GM should be encouraged to wield power, to increase player uncertainty.
